This is a simple scientific calculator which calculates, arthimatic functions, trigonometric functions, inverse functions, hiperbolic functions, and power functions.

## Order of Operations

As we learned in the previous exercise, we can use the () symbols as the order of operations operators. However, this isn't the only way the order of operations is determined.

In math, PEMDAS is an acronym that helps students remember the order in which multiple operations are performed. The order is:

    Parentheses (whatever is inside the parenthesis is performed first)
    Exponents
    Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
    Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

C# follows the same order as PEMDAS except for exponents. While there's no exponent operator in C#, you can use the System.Math.Pow() method, which is available from the .NET Class Library. The module "Call methods from the .NET Class Library using C#" will feature this method and others.
